# ⚡ Synapse: Advanced Multi-Query AI Assistant

Synapse is a high-performance **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application built to extract precise, well-organized information from PDF documents. By utilizing **Multi-Query Expansion**, Synapse overcomes the limitations of standard keyword search, ensuring it finds the most relevant information even if the user's question is vague.



## 🌟 Key Features

* **Multi-Query Expansion:** Uses Groq's Llama 3.3 to rewrite user queries into multiple variations, increasing retrieval accuracy (Recall).
* **Persistent Cloud Memory:** Integrated with **Neon DB (PGVector)** to store document embeddings permanently in the cloud.
* **Explainable AI:** Provides direct **Source Citations** including page numbers and exact text snippets for every answer.
* **Context-Aware Chat:** Maintains a session-based history to handle follow-up questions (e.g., "What about the second one?").
* **Sub-Second Latency:** Powered by **Groq LPU** inference for near-instant responses.
